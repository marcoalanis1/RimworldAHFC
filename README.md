After many playthroughs and hoping to escape urban reality through a quasi farming and animsl tending simulator, I have realized that doing approximate calculations by hand has become incredibly tedios and repetitive. Thus, this calculator was born.

It is a simple calculator done in python because i like it more than doing excel macros. In addition, i am refreshing myself on software development processes. Feel free to add suggestions. Hopefully i can host a webserver using this code i feel the playerbase (daily 14000) will like this tool.
