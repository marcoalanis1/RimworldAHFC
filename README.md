After many playthroughs and hoping to escape urban reality through a quasi farming and animal tending simulator, I have realized that doing approximate calculations by hand has become incredibly tedious and repetitive. Thus, this calculator was born.

It is a simple calculator done in python because I like it more than doing excel macros. In addition, i am refreshing myself on software development processes. Feel free to add suggestions. Hopefully I can host a webserver using this code. I feel the playerbase (daily 14000) will like this tool.
